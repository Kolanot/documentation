# Code lists

This folder contains the PEPPOL code lists for:
* Participant identifier issuing agencies
* Document types
* Processes
* Transport profiles

## Usage notes

### Participant identifier issuing agencies

Rows marked as "deprecated" should not be used for newly issued documents, as the respective identifier issuing agency is no longer active/valid. Deprecated scheme IDs may however not be reused for different agencies as existing exchanged documents may refer to them.

### Document types

Rows marked as "deprecated" should not be used for newly issued documents.
It is important to note that this is a dynamic list. Over time new services will be added. Developers should take this into account when designing and implementing solutions for PEPPOL services.
